The "Expat License"
-------------------

The specific license above is, in least ambiguous terms, the "Expat
License". Specifically, it is the same license as that of Expat itself
(of the 2.1.1 release, among many others). This license is identified
elsewhere as:

*   ["Expat License" by the
    FSF](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat) (see also [their
    notes](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat))
*   ["MIT License (Expat)" by
    Debian](https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/mit)
*   ["The MIT License" by the OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Since this is one of several distinct licenses known as "MIT License",
refer to this license as the "Expat License" to avoid confusion.
